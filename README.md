# Happy Thoughts

Create an app to send happy thoughts to, using API, React state and useEffect.


## The problem

The biggest struggle for this project was the fact that I don't entirely know what useEffect actually does. I also haven't got the loading to work as I want, with the page not refreshing showing my loading icon. When I got it to work, the message I wrote in the send form, did ot disappear, so will have to look into that better.
